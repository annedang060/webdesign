<div class="about-div2">

    <div class="about-div2-text">
        <h3>SINCE 1988</h3>
        <p>Like many before him, Richard Jaffray spent a good amount of his teenage years waiting tables. <br> By the time he turned 19, he realized he had a passion for the restaurant business that could go
            <br> far beyond a part time job. <br><br>
            In 1986, Richard opened his first restaurant, Café Cucamongas, selling cappuccinos, sandwiches <br>and ice cream. In 1988, at the age of 23, he sold Cucamongas and opened the first Cactus Club
            <br>Cafe in North Vancouver, British Columbia. The goal was to offer a fun, upscale restaurant <br>where you would be welcomed with great food and friendly service in a relaxed, unpretentious
            <br>atmosphere. <br><br>
            In its first 25 years, Cactus Club Cafe grew to include 25 locations and employed 2,000 people. <br>Today, the restaurant is a national brand and is experiencing the fastest growth in its history.
            <br><br>
            Although some things have changed through the years, the original Cactus philosophy remains <br>intact: continuous improvement and the highest quality is sought in every
            menu item, every <br>design element and every aspect of the guest experience.</p>
